<h3>Why "Task a Teen"?</h3>
<p>We want to connect teens to people in their community by offering them a way to easily earn money with simple tasks. Real jobs in the real world require a long hiring process, interviews, stress-- with Task a Teen, none of that is required. We reach out to two sides: people in the community, who need someone to do a certain task, and teenagers, who need money and experience. </p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
  <p>If you don’t have a profile, make one! “Find a Task” and “Offer a Task” are the two main components to our website. In “Offer a Task”, you can post what you need done, your general location, and your contact information. In “Find a Task”, you can search for a task you want to do with the general location. Past contact information, we expect only teens to approach offers and for the exchange to be safe and appropriate. </p>
